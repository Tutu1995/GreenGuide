						<h2 class="text-success"><strong>Introduction to LoveGreenGuide<strong></h2>
						<p>China is famous for Confucianism which was long the basis for ruling the country. Through thousands of years under this moral system, we accomplished tremendous achievements and accumulated many cultural treasures. But as time has gone by, we’ve started to lose the senses of virtue and morality, and economic development has contributed to a loss of public spirit and responsibility.</p>
						<p>As descendants of the Yandi and Huangdi emperors, we burden the responsibility to bring back the moral and cultural treasures we used to have. “LoveGreenGuide” connects the impact of reputation and rewards with morality through the assistance of modern technology. It helps to restrain poor behavior by inviting the public’s assistance.
